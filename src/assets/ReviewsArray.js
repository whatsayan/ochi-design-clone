            review: "They were transparent about the time and the stages of the project. The end product is high quality, and I feel confident about how they were handholding the client through the process. I feel like I can introduce them to someone who needs to put a sales deck together from scratch, and they would be able to handhold the client experience from 0 to 100 very effectively from story to design. 5/5"

            review: "Ihor and his team tackled the projects with great professionalism and creativity. They understood our brand value and turned this into excellent slide designs. The process was seamless and very effective, so we decided to roll this out across all our presentation decks. Furthermore, their understanding, professionalism, and creativity have secured a continued partnership."

When I showed our management and HR teams the presentations OCHI developed, they were amazed — the final product was exactly what we needed to create a better experience for new employees and our clients."

            review: "The service received from OCHI was absolutely first-class. Their close attention to detail, and deep thought in terms of narrative, flow, and aesthetics, completely exceeded my expectations, which were very high from the outset. Especially loved and appreciated the creation of visuals, animation, and advice around the look and feel that we are after. We will definitely continue working with Ihor and his team. I cannot recommend them highly enough."

Ochi delivered more than I was expecting and we were really surprised with the quality of his work. Will work with Ochi design again for sure!"

Ihor and his team delivered exactly that! They are very talented designers who understand the real business problem we are trying to solve and iterate over many drafts to achieve the best possible outcome. We are looking for a long-lasting working relationship!"

Everything moved with a milestone dynamic brief via Notion which was handy to track progress. We’re very happy with the process and the final product. All was handled well and professionally."
